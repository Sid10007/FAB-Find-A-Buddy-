# Problem Statement

As we know there are a lots of learning resources are available on the internet, but often the path is not clear like how to begin so at that point personal level interaction is always superior which we do not get without knowing them.Just due to this nature of introvert they are not being able to ask for a help from superior which makes a big gap in education.

# Solution
To reduce this communication gap between people having same interest or wants to learn new concepts from others peers, we target to connect more people together to make this world a better place to live ,new places can be made familiar very quickly.Introverts at times lack in necessary networking skills, will be comfortable using our platform .Common interests always the best ice breakers.


# Idea:

Matching people living nearby.
People with complimentary/common interests and skillsets can come together to produce synergic effects.
Teaching and learning can go hand in hand.
Volunteers can add to the cause.
Useful in colleges especially. Juniors may find seniors and the possible exchange of info would be invaluable.
Networking always beneficial.


# Example:

Person A experienced at web dev but wanting to learn machine learning may be matched with Person B who is good at machine learning trying to explore the web.


# Possible Extension:

Working class people can bond on Sundays etc over a game.
Old people can find company. 
Home makers can leverage their skills in spare time.
